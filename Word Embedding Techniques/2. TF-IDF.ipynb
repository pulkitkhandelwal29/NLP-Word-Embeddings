    "paragraph = \"He was a man of dreams and ideas. He dreamt of making India one of the super-powers in the world. His idea of dreaming was really different. He emphasized that the dreams are not those which you see when you sleep but are those which never let you sleep. Undoubtedly, these are the precious words of wisdom. He always encouraged everyone to work hard and not think about the result. He believed, if you work hard, you will definitely get the result as well.Some countless efforts and contributions are made by Dr. Kalam for the sake of the nation. He was awarded by Bharat Ratna in the year 1997. But, the biggest grief is that we have no longer this beautiful amongst us. While delivering his speech at the Institute of Management, Shillong he got cardiac arrest and collapsed. Even after great efforts, he left us, making 27 July 2015 one of the saddest days in the history of India.At last, I would like to say even though he left us, he is still in our hearts as the inspiration and the motivation. His golden words and miraculous deeds will always be remembered. He was a man of high stature and value who taught us the way to transform our nation and we shall always be grateful to him.Much thank you to all of you. Have a great evening!\""
